DOM is the HTML Document
Finding elements in the DOM
    - get element by ID
    - get elements by tag name
    - get element by class name
    - query selector all (returns an array)
    - query selector (only returns one thing)
These above ^^ will allow things to controlled like an object
Interacting with DOM
